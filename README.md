# Principal Components Analysis
The dataset downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The reference [Cortez et al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.)


  Attribute Information:
  1.Type
  2.Alcohol
  3.Malic
  4.Ash
  5.Alcalinity
  6.Magnesium
  7.Phenols
  8.Flavanoids
  9.Nonflavanoids
  10.Color
  11.Hue
  12.Dilution
  13.Proline

# Target
My target is to analyze the wine.csv file by applying Pricipal Components analysis. Then find the weights for each indiviual variable and then choose the first six components which carries the most imporatnce. Then apply Linear Regression model to find the best model.
